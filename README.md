iOSTicTacToe
============


The code is overcomplex, its saves many unnessecary information - for debugging purposes. It's not a iOS game, its a TicTacToe playing bots debugging workbench.


Minimax algorithm is full tree recursive search, its super slow. Feel free to optimize it.

Right now its so slow that game takes forever to calculate first move in 4x4 matrix.
